Normally the developers have to buy PalmSecure™ SDK for standalone development and additional server license for client-server application. To save the cost and time we provide:
1) The authentication server to build your application quickly with a PalmSecure™ sensor;
2) If you want to set up the server in your company we will install the server for you;
3) Windows、Linux、and Android application samples with source codes.
