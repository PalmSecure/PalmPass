Normally the developers have to buy PalmSecure™ SDK for standalone development and additional server license for client-server application. To save the cost and time we provide:
1) The authentication server to set up your application quickly. You need only buy PalmSecure™ sensor from Fujitsu or us;
2) If you want to build your server in your company you can buy the service and we will install the server for you;
3) Windows、Linux、or Android application samples with source code.
